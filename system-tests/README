Executing main.sh submit all system tests to a compute grid.

Then, main.sh waits for everything to complete before returning.


# system tests

In the tests directory, system tests are.

Each of them has a entry point called main.sh and symbolic links to data entries.

Before calling the main.sh of aa system test, 

1. move to the directory containing it;
2. export TEST_NAME, RAY_GIT_PATH and NSLOTS (NSLOTS is the number of compute cores)
3. bash main.sh


# builds

Before running system tests, Ray builds are generated. They are deposited in builds.
